This is my first big project in Java + HTML and MySQL, this is a study I have done to improve my logic skills and also learn more about Java and POO.In this project you can create an account, 
log in and out, while you log in you can create a new task, visualise it on the page and update it to finished and also delete it. Everything works behind MySQL using the CRUD formula.
The HTML and CSS is pretty basic because the idea was to learn Java with database, but as soon as I improve my frontend skills I will update this project.
